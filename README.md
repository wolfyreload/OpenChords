# OpenChords #

OpenChords is a digital songbook for guitarists and other musicians

## Background ##

OpenChords was built to solve two primary needs:

* Easily transpose the key of a song

* Filing music is tedious and I wanted a fully paperless system for musicians

## Features ##

* Present any song with chords and lyrics in a easy to read high contrast color-theme

* Transpose the song key and change capo of the songs on the fly

* Export your songs to a tablet and print friendly HTML format

* Easily export a set of songs to OpenSong (a great open source software for displaying lyrics over a projector)

* New Cross-platform UI using eto.forms.
