  <lyrics>[V1]
.     C                    F          C                 
 When peace like a river attendeth my way,              
.      Am           D           G                       
 When sorrows like sea billows roll;                    
.    C       F              D            G              
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,           
.       C           F    G    C                         
 “It is well, it is well with my soul.”                 

[C]
.      C            G                                   
 It is well, (it is well,)                              
.        G              C                               
 With my soul, (with my soul,)                          
.      F           C    G       C                       
 It is well, it is well with my soul.                   

[V2]
.       C                           F             C     
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, 
.    Am           D          G                          
 Let this blest assurance control,                      
.     C            F         D         G                
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,           
.         C            F     G      C                   
 And hath shed his own blood for my soul.               

[V3]
.   C                         F        C                
 My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought!         
.   Am          D            G                          
 My sin, not in part but the whole                      
.   C             F            D          G             
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,         
.           C                F     G    C               
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!           

[V4]
.     C                           F              C      
 And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, 
.    Am               D         G                       
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;                 
.    C             F              D            G        
 The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,   
.     C         F    G       C                          
 Even so, it is well with my soul.
