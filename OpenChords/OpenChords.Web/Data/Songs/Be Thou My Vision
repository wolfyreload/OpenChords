.D          Bm7       G          D                      
 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart,                 
.A             Bm7        G              A              
 Naught be all else to me save that Thou art;           
.Gmaj7        F#m7       D         G    A               
 Thou my best thought by day or by night,               
.D         Bm7           G2          D                  
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.             

[V2]
.D          Bm7        G            D                   
 Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word,               
.A      Bm7           G             A                   
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;               
.Gmaj7         F#m7        D          G  A              
 Thou my great Father, and I thy true son,              
.D          Bm7           G2          D                 
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.              

[V3]
.E        C#m7          A           E                   
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,             
.B           C#m7      A         B                      
 Thou mine Inheritance now and always;                  
.Amaj7         G#m7  E           A    B                 
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,                 
.E            C#m7       A2            E                
 High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.             

[V4]
.E            C#m7      A       E                       
 High King of heaven my victory won,                    
.B           C#m7           A                 B         
 May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun;      
.Amaj7       G#m7           E      A   B                
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,                
.E           C#m7      A2       E                       
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
