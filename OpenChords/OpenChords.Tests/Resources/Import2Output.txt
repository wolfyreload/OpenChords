. D      D7        G         D
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
.     Bm      E           A  A7
 that saved a wretch like me;
.  D        D7       G       D
 I once was lost but now I'm found,
.    Bm        A     G   D
 was blind but now I see.

[V2]
.     D          D7        G        D
 Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
.    Bm       E       A      A7
 and grace my fears relieved;
.    D        D7       G       D
 How precious did that grace appear
.    Bm     A       G      D
 the hour I first believed!

[V3]
.        D    D7       G
 Through many dangers, toils,
.    D        Bm     E     A    A7
 and snares I have already come;
.     D          D7         G         D
 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far

 and grace will lead me home.

 When we've been there ten thousand
.D            Bm      E      A   A7
 years bright shining as the sun;
.      D       D7      G          D
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
.     Bm        A       G   D
 than when we'd first begun!
