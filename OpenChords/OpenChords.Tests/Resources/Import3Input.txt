[Verse 1]
 D      D7        G         D
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
     Bm      E           A  A7
that saved a wretch like me;

[CHORUS]
 My chains are gone

[Verse 2]
     D          D7        G        D
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    Bm       E       A      A7
and grace my fears relieved;

[CHORUS]
 My chains are gone

[Verse 3]
        D    D7       G
Through many dangers, toils,
    D        Bm     E     A    A7
and snares I have already come;

[CHORUS]
 My chains are gone

[Verse 4]
     D          D7        G
When we've been there ten thousand
D            Bm      E      A   A7
years bright shining as the sun;

[CHORUS]
 My chains are gone

[SOLO]
 My chains are gone

[TAG]
 My chains are gone
